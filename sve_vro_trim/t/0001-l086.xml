      <t id="2">The Raven is the answer of the Teladi to the other races producing battleships. The ships front is covered in 4 heavy-destroyer class weapon systems alongside 6 heavy turrets, giving the Raven an insane amount of forward facing firepower, making the Raven very effective at frontal attacks and breaking enemy formations. The rest of the body is similarily covered in medium and large sized turrets, enabling to Raven to engage enemies all around of itself all at once. The ship also features the strongest hull integrity of all battleships as well as decent shielding.</t>

      <t id="2">While nothing is really known for cetrain about the J-class (just was with any other xenon ship) from what can be observed it seems to be built on the same hull as the K. Compared to the K it is reported to have more firepower, and as such sits between the K and the I-class.</t>
